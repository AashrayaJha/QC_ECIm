# QC_EC_Im_quad
Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and $E/K$ an elliptic curve. Assume $E(K)$ has rank $2$. We find the quadratic Chabauty set of $p$-adic integral points of $E$. We also include a sieve, which eliminates some spurious $p$-adic points if $E(K)_{\text{tors}}=\{0\}$. In some cases, we do manage to get the exact set of integral points. This code is based on that of Francesca Bianchi's repository https://github.com/bianchifrancesca/QC_elliptic_imaginary_quadratic_rank_2
